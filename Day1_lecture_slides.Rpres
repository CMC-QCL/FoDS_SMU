Expectations
========================================================
1. __Our first communication language is English__  
    *You can selectively use Korean (as I can understand Korean well)*

1. __Labs will be run by TAs__  
    *Due to TZ issue, instructor will answer your questions on the lab projects in the evening (Korea Time)*

1. __During the first 2-week study, you will need to find a capstone project__  
    *Instructor and TAs will help you on this*

Introduction to Data Science
========================================================


What is Data Science?  
=============

Data science consists of the methods and tools for collecting, manipulating, and studying data with a goal of making informed decisions.

[Breakout Session 1] Open Discussion
=================

5 min: Discuss briefly about what the informed decisions might be in your domain/field

5 min: Share your team's example(s) when you come back to the main room.

Typical Data Science Project Workflow
===================
```{r, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Data Wrangling', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/data-science.png')
```

R and RStudio
=============


What is R?
========================================================
* R is a statistical programming language and environment.
* R is open source/free.
* R is widely used/preferred.
* R is cross-platform.
* R is hard to learn.

What is not R?
========================================================
* S: R's ancestor
* S-Plus: Commercial; modern implementation of S
* SAS: Commercial; widely used in the commercial analytics.
* SPSS: Commercial; easy to use; widely used in Social Science.
* MATLAB: Commercial; can do some Stats. 
* Python: Also can do some Stats; good in deep learning

R or Python?
=============
R is Useful and easier to do Statistical Modeling
Python has a great collection of libraries to do Machine learning and Deep Learning

What is RStudio?
========================================================
* Integrated Development Environment for R
* Nice combination of GUI and CLI
* Free and commercial version
* 4 main windows, tabs, etc
* Version control: Git and VPN
* Debugging 
* Documentation: R Markdown
  - install.packages("rmarkdown")
  - http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
* Presentation slides: R Presentation (this one!)


How to Get Help
========================================================
* Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r
* Cross-Validated: the statistics Q&A site http://stats.stackexchange.com/
* Google


[Breakout Session 2] Where to get help?
=============
- Find Korean websites/community that you can ask questions about R programming (5 min)
- Suggest them in the main room (5 min)

[Hands-On] Learn R's Documentation Tools 
========================
__R Markdown__

1. Create a new R Markdown (Rmd) file
