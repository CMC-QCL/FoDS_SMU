# Foundtations of Data Science with Capstone at SMU, Summer 2021

## Course Description

Data science is the interdisciplinary study of the tools and theory behind using data to extract knowledge. It combines ideas from statistics, computer science, and particular domains in the physical and social sciences in order to make predictions and optimal decisions.

This summer intensive course is designed with a practical approach. The students will be guided to learn the basics and move on to more advanced topics in 2 weeks. The final 1 week will be dedicated to practicing and presenting data science skills and competency through capstone projects. 

## Session 1: Building Foundations (2 weeks)
During the first 2 weeks, you will learn the foundations of data science including the basics of how to structure, visualize, transform, and model data. The primary programming language that we will be using is R, which is both simple to use and was designed around using data. The development environment we will be using is RStudio. Both R and RStudio are open source, and so may be downloaded to your personal laptop for free.

## Session 2: Practicing Knowledge (1 week)  
The Data Science Capstone is a team-based, project-based session, providing an opportunity to apply data science skills and knowledge obtained from the first 2 weeks of the foundation session. Teams of two or three students, under the direction of the course instructor and teaching assistants, will be working on a data project. The primary objective is to educate the students in solving real world data science problems in professional settings by leveraging their own computational, statistical, and domain skills. The capstone will end with a final presentation.

## Student Expectation and Project Outcomes of Capstone

Students will work independently as well as collaboratively in the group for at least <<X>> hours a day on modeling, analysis, data manipulation/wrangling, visualization, etc. as needed for the project. At the same time, students will be guided to learn soft skills such as project management, presentation, and communication through the daily sync. Students will be expected to read necessary background articles/books, learn additional tools, and log their own work and time.

Each team will provide the following outcomes in a timely manner:
•	A project proposal detailing the intended goals, methodology, and deliverables
•	A final presentation on the project outcomes
•	A GitHub page containing all outcomes (README, data, codes, analyses results, etc.)

## Textbook

We will be using R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. This book is open source and can be found/downloaded online. Korean version is also available online.
